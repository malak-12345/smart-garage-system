# 🚗 Smart Garage System

This project is a **smart parking garage simulation** developed as part of our **Electronics course** at the Faculty of Computers and Information.

It uses **Arduino with ultrasonic sensors, servo motor, and LCD** to detect vehicles entering or exiting the garage and display available parking slots in real-time.

## 🎯 Features

- Detect car **entry** and **exit** using ultrasonic sensors.
- Show **available slots** on LCD.
- Block entry when garage is full.
- Prevent exit when garage is already empty.
- Real-time gate control using **servo motor**.
- Automatic screen update with useful messages.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Arduino C/C++
- Servo motor
- Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04)
- LCD 16x2
- Logic-based decision making
